## Testing

1. Fork this Repository
2. Clone it
3. Run Developer Host Extension (Debugger) on VSCode

### Host Extension Window <!-- omit in toc -->

1. **Settings**
2. **Workspace** > Appearance > **Color Theme** <!--- Working with Workspace instead of User makes it less confusing -->
3. Select one of the **Nebula Oni** themes at the end of the list <!--- When you run Debugger, the host Color Theme goes to the end of the list  -->
4. If you want to see immediate changes, **Edit** the **JSON** file of the selected **Nebula Oni Color Scheme** inside the folder `themes`

<!--- Check the VSCode Customization page and test your suggestion to see if works. Some TextMate and Semantic Tokens unintentionally change some unexpected scope, the suggestion would be to test it with a more extensive code snippet. -->
